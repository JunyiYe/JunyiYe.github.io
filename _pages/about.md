<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Junyi Ye is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), conducting research under the mentorship of Distinguished Professor [Guiling (Grace) Wang](https://web.njit.edu/~gwang/). He holds a master’s degree in Computer Science from NJIT and a master’s degree in Optics from Shanghai University, where he studied under the guidance of Professor [Ye Dai](https://physics.shu.edu.cn/info/1082/1337.htm).

Junyi’s research interests lie at the intersection of large language models, graph neural networks, time series analysis, and multimodal reasoning. His work focuses on developing innovative AI frameworks for solving real-world challenges, including privacy-preserving information retrival, financial modeling, and explainable decision-making AI systems. He is particularly interested in exploring the creative and interpretive capabilities of AI in applications spanning finance, healthcare, and decision making.
